# Welcome to Nathan Liang's personal website!

My name is Nathan Liang, and I am a psychology researcher who enjoys 
programming in both my professional work and in my free time. 

I built this website from scratch using the React JavaScript library, and I
styled it with both React-Bootstrap and custom Sass.

I intend to update this website relatively frequently, around once every couple
of months, mostly to keep up with my current research projects and publications.
